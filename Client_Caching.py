Description: 
The file content read by the client is retained in a buffer of the client program. 
If the file content requested by the client is available in the cache, 
the client may read the cached content directly without contacting the server. 
On the other hand, the updates made by the client to file content are always sent to the server immediately. 
The approximate one-copy update semantics (used by NFS as described in the lecture) is required to be implemented to maintain cache consistency.
Parameter: freshness interval t
Need to maintain some meta-information of cached content 
(e.g., the file pathname of the cached content, the time when the cached content was last validated).
In NFS
T_c: the time when the cache entry was last validated
T_mclient: the time when the cached file was last modified at server
T: current time
Entry is considered valid when T - T_c < t
T - T_c < t, no need to evaluate further, read data from cache
T - T_c â‰¥ t, issue getattr call to server to obtain T_mserver(update T_c)
    T_mclient = T_mserver, the cache entry is valid (the data have not been modified at the server) and T_c is updated to current time
    T_mclient < T_mserver, the cache entry is invalidated, and a new request is sent to server for updated data, T_c is also updated
